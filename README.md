# Brain_Tumor_Classification

The competition challenged participants to develop a deep learning model that could accurately classify brain MRI images displaying three different types of tumors - glioma, meningioma, pituitary - and no tumor, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It was an intense battle, with many teams from various organizations participating, many of whom had far more experience than us and were well-known in hackathon culture. However, our team's drive, passion, and commitment gave us the advantage, and we were able to secure first place.

We utilized transfer learning to leverage the EfficientNetB7 model, which is known to be top-of-the-line and the state-of-the-art when it comes to image processing. Our model achieved an incredible accuracy of 99.3% ✅. To achieve this, we used #NoisyStudent checkpoints for EfficientNetB7 which greatly improved our results, we also used data augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning. Our model is a great tool for doctors and healthcare professionals, as it can augment their ability to confidently identify and make decisions based on patient scans.
